# HB9HUS - Notes on learning CW
## Introduction
This document contains my findings that I had during my journey for learning CW by myself. It does not only focus on the pure learning of receiving CW but also tries to give an overview on sending and procedures. It will certainly contain errors. If so, write me or start a discussion with a github issue.

There are obviously many different ways you can learn be it different ways to teach it your self or by taking courses. For example, I've only heard good things about the CW courses of the [long island cw club](https://longislandcwclub.org/).

Most stuff I wont write in too much detail but link to the places where I learned about it. I try to give simple recommendations where there is much choice (almost everywhere).

### What is there to learn
When starting to learn CW, you are probably not aware, that there are many different things that you can learn. These are:
- Receiving CW:
Receiving CW is the hard part of being a CW operator. Starting with the letters
- Sending CW:
Sending is much easier than receiving.
- Procedures:
Being a CW operator includes not only sending and receiving the letters and words in CW but many procedural things such as abbreviations or QSO formats.

I will try to describe the different points in the following chapters.

### How long will it take
This is a very individual question and depends on many factors. The dominant factor is the time you invest into your practice. Some values I have found online are (dont remember the sources, sorry):
- You should be able to learn the letters within 2-3 months.
- Soon after that you can go on the air and do a first very slow QSO
- It will probably take a year to be proficient at 15wpm
- It usually seems to take about 2 years to get to 25wpm

But have a look at section "Receiving speed" below, there is not "one" speed you are at.

## Receiving CW
Receiving or copying CW is not hard, but needs a lot of pracitce. The recommended things are:
- Have FUN! change the practice if it gets boring
- practice daily at least 10-30min
- stopp when you get tired
- multiple short sessions is better than one long
- don't listen to slow CW, space the letters out if necessary (farnsworth timing)
- learn by sound, don't use any form of memnonic (e.g. charts)

Some very good information is to be found on the [advice page](https://morsecode.ninja/advice/) of morse code ninja.

### The letters
Learning the letters is the obvious starting point on your journey to learn CW. There are many texts that describe this process in detail (e.g. https://www.qsl.net/kb5wck/morse-.html).

There are probably hundreds of tools for learning CW to be found online. Every ham with coding skills seems to have written one.

Letters in CW are sent as a sequence of Dits (short) and Dahs (long) sounds. The focus should be on learning the sounds of the letters and not have some sort of mental crutch to remember them (such as diagrams or mnemonics). If you have to think about a graphical diagram when hearing a sound, you will never get fast.

My simple recommendation is to use [Learn CW Online - LCWO](https://lcwo.net). This webpage is used by many and can give you an immediate start. Unfortunately it is not (at the time of this writing) responsive and not easy to use on mobile. There you can take [Morse Mania](https://www.ecosia.org/search?tt=mzl&q=morse%20mania).

Try to learn with a fast character speed such as 20wpm and slow down the farnsworth timing to a speed you can copy.

### Hard copy or head copy
You must decide, whether you want to write down what you hear or just reconstruct the words and sentences in your head.

Hard copy (pen or keyboard) has some speed limitations. You can only write so fast. In the beginning and when you are a fast typist, this wont matter too much.

Head copy gives you more instant access to the meaning of the communication. You do not have to read what was sent.

Most recommendations I have seen recommended to start with or switch early to head-copy. This worked for me as well.

For a more detailed description of this have a look at [advice page](https://morsecode.ninja/advice/#SoYouWantToGoFaster) on morse code ninja.

### Getting faster
Once you know your letters, you probably want to get faster, get rid of the farnsworth timing and get up to a speed which can be used on the air.

This is done by listening to different forms of texts in your tool of choice. For me this tools are most of the time the videos of [morse code ninja](https://morsecode.ninja/practice/index.html).

There are many different dimensions you can improve on. I will explain some of them.

QSO elements and standard QSO structure are very important to learn after you know the letters. These will get you on the air. As soon as you master them somewhat you can follow a standard QSO. Train the [elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hbx_m3RLj8), and QSO [phrases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hreSmzw6u5Y).

Instant character recognition is the skill to understand the cw-character without counting or thinking about the dits and dahs. This can be trained with sequences of characters such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLb6BOJwRMc) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdh0wUAf07k&feature=youtu.be). Once you master these, increase the length of the sequence and later the speed.

The longer words get, the harder it gets to remember the characters that came earlier. To train this skill, start with short words and increase the length continuously or learn common words. Example videos are [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npofTfIgSHA&feature=youtu.be) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npofTfIgSHA&feature=youtu.be). Here as well, increase the length or the number of words, later the speed.

The next dimension is sentence length. As you need to train to remember characters sent, you need to train words sent. To train this, you can practice [word sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvXRN9TcT14) and [sentences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zu7oBQ_gT4&feature=youtu.be). Within these you can increase the length or the number of words. As usual, increase the speed later.

It can make sense, to practice simple things (e.g. three letter combinations) at a higher speed and more difficult things (e.g. top 100 words) at a slightly slower speed.

Don't forget to go online as well early on to train your ear to real operators. It can already be fun to recognize single letters in the stream of a qso.

This can easily be done with a [web sdr](http://websdr.org/).

### Getting fast
As I am not fast yet, I can not really comment on this. Have a look at this article on morse code ninja: https://morsecode.ninja/advice/#LearningApproachToQRQ

Tools and links:
- https://www.dxatlas.com/MorseRunner/
- http://www.highspeedclub.org/

### Receiving speed
CW is measured in words per minute (WPM) or characters per minute (CPM). CPM is 5 times WPM.

What speed you can receive depends on many different factors:
- perfect timing or human operator that makes timing errors
- only cw sounds or background noise and fading
- understanding the structure of the text that you receive (e.g. standard qso helps a lot)
- your daily form
- number of repetitions (e.g. you can copy a callsign of a contest station listening to it multiple times at a very high speed)

This means that, even if you can copy multiple words at 22 wpm with a morse training tool, does not mean that you can do so on the air. After a training session, you will be faster than before, but this will drop down again.

More details on speed:
- https://morsecode.world/international/timing.html

### Common errors and mishaps
Some things seem to happen to different people learning CW
- confuse symmetrical letters, e.g. K and R
- Problems with Dits: E, I, S, H can be hard to copy when in sequence
- Often it happens that after some letters, you anticipate the word and stop listening. Just try to focus on the next letter in that case.
- The same can happen with words.

Many of the errors disappear with training. If you notice a pattern (e.g. dits causing problems) try to find an excercise to resolve this (such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdh0wUAf07k)).

## Sending CW
Sending is much easier than receiving. 

### The key to use
There are several different typs of key for sending morse code. As you can imagine there are many and divergent opinions on which one is best.

I decided on starting with an automatic keyer with a paddle. With this setup, you do not have to get the timings of Dits and Dahs right. The keyer does that for you.

### Practice sending
When you have a certain proficiency receiving CW it will be easy to know how to send a character. Getting your fingers to do so can be a little trickier.

You can take any source of text and send it. Some ideas are:
- an example QSO
- Text from a news- or wikipedia article
- listen to a text in CW and then send it

You will notice with which characters or character-combinations pose a problem. Repeat them until you can send them reliably.

### Sending from written text
When you can read the text you want to send, you just have to translate the written letters to morse code. This is much easier than sending everything from your head.

To practice this, you can take any text or written down QSO and send it.

### Sending from your head
When sending from your head, you need to spell out the word you want to send. This can take away brain power for the sending.

Practice this by sending examples QSOs from your head.

### Common errors and mishaps
As with receiving, errors happen during sending: 
- the fingers suddenly forget how to send. this can be embarrasing as you just can't get any meaningfull cw out for a moment. if this happens, relax, maybe shake your hand and try to send very deliberate and with clear spacing between the letters.
- If you need to send an unknown word from your head, you can get confused. If, for example, you are in a new QTH, write it down.

## Procedures
### Online behaviour
The standard advice on how to behave online is to listen and learn. This is certainly not bad advice but it helps if you have references.

Two resources are:
- The [ARRL Operating Ethics](http://www.arrl.org/operating-ethics)
- The [DX Code of conduct](https://dx-code.com/)

In my experience reality can look different than these documents, but many of the things in there are sound and make sense.

### Abbreviations
CW is a slow form of communication. To increase the density of information, we use many abbreviations and the so called Q-Codes (see next section). When you first have a look at lists with these, you can easily feel overwhelmed by their length. But fear not in practice, only few of them are frequently used. You just have to learn the most frequent ones and can postpone the rest to later.

This is my list of common abbreviations:
- AGN: Again
- ANT: Antenna
- CFM: Confirm
- CUAGN: see you again, also CU AGN
- CQ: Calling
- DE: From
- DR: Dear
- DX: Distance
- EFHW: end fed half wave antenna
- ES: And
- FB: Fine Business -> good
- FER: for
- GM/GA/GE: Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening
- HPE: hope
- HR: here
- HW: How copy?
- K: over
- NR: Number/Near
- OM: Old man (operator)
- OP: Operator
- PSE: Please
- PWR: power
- R: roger/acknowledge
- RIG: transceiver
- RPT/RPRT: report
- RST: Signal report (see below)
- TEMP: temperature
- TNX/TKS: thanks
- TU: Thank you, often followed by two dits
- UR: your
- W: watt
- WX: weather
- 73: best regards

There are many more, but they are heard not so often, see: https://cwops.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/CW-Abbreviations.pdf

### Q-Codes
Q-Codes are three letter codes starting with the letter Q (as the name implies). They can often be used as a question or as a statement. Many of the lists you find online are confusing (at least to me) and it is not clear from the description when and how to use them.

This is my list of common abbreviations:
- QRL?: is the frequency busy?
- QRZ?: who is calling me?
- QRS: send more slowly, e.g. PSE QRS
- QSB: Signal is fading (during RST report)
- QSO: a radio contact
- QTH: my location is

Many more to be found online such as here https://jota.uniq.com.au/radio/qcode.html

### Prosigns
[Prosigns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosigns_for_Morse_code) (procedural signs) are special signals used to mark special points in a message or chommunication.

They are usually written as a combination of letters with an overline. The letters are sent without space between them.

Frequent prosigns are:
- A̅R̅: out, end of message
- B̅K̅: break in, hand over to the other station without sending the callsigns again.
- B̅T̅: break, start a new section in your message (like a small pause)
- S̅K̅: silent key, sent to signal end of communication

The use of these is best learned by listening how they are used. The (theoretical?) proper use is described in the [arrl operating ethics](http://www.arrl.org/operating-ethics).

### RST system
The RST system is used for exchanging information on the quality of the signal.

It consists of three numbers. Which describe readability (1-5), strength (1-9) and tone (1-9).

RST is usually sent in this way: "RST 599 599" or "UR RST IS 599 599". The value is usually repeated. Often, the 9 is abbreviated with N: "RST 5NN 5NN" (see the section on abbreviated numbers).

The most frequent value that is reported "correctly" on the air ist strength. RST such as 559, 579 etc. can be heard a lot. Readability other than 5 is sometimes reported as well. I have never heard anyone on the air reporting a tone other than 9.

Some stations always send 599, especially during contests. This removes the whole meaning of the system in this situation, it is just some text sent.

For more details look at the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-S-T_system)

### Abbreviated numbers
Numbers can be abbreviated (called cut numbers) when it is clear from the context that they are numbers. This happens usually during the RST report and in contests. The most most frequent number to cut is 9 which becomes N.

Other common replacements are T, A for 0, 1.

You can train these [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzcCy1qGy60&t=0s).

The full list is:
| Number    | Replacement |
| -------- | ------- |
| 0	| T |
|1	| A |
|2	| U |
|3	| V |
|4	| 4 |
|5	| E |
|6	| 6 |
|7	| B |
|8	| D |
|9	| N |

### QSO-Formats
- the letters
- abbreviations and q-codes
- QSO formats

### A "regular" QSO
A normal QSO follows a somewhat fixed structure. This structure greatly helps you understanding the incoming CW as you know what to anticipate.

The high level structure is:
    S: Calling
    Y: Callsign
    S: Greeting, Thanks, Report (RST), Name, QTH
    Y: Thanks for report, Report (RST), Name, QTH
    S: (optional) equipment, power, antenna, weather
    Y: (optional) equipment, power, antenna, weather
    S: Farewell
    Y: Farewell

This could look like this:

    S: CQ CQ CQ de A1BCD A1BCD PSE K
    Y: A1BCD DE HB9HUS K
    S: HB9HUS DE A1BCD GM ES TNX FER CALL = UR RST 599 5NN = OP IS JOHN JOHN = QTH PARIS PARIS, HW? HB9HUS DE A1BCD K
    Y: R R A1BCD DE HB9HUS TNX FER RPRT DR JOHN = UR RST 599 5NN = OP IS STEFAN STEFAN = QTH NR BERN NR BERN, HW? A1BCD DE HB9HUS K
    S: HB9HUS DE A1BCD RIG FTDX10, PWR 100W = ANT DIPOLE = WX SUNNY ES TEMP 10C = HW? BK
    Y: BK RIG HOMEBREW, PWR 5W = ANT EFHW = WX COLD ES TEMP MINUS 1C BK
    S: BK TKS FER FB QSO ES HPE CUAGN = 73 73 ES TU HB9HUS DE A1BCD SK
    Y: A1BCD DE HB9HUS TNX FER NICE QSO ES 73 A1BCD DE HB9HUS SK TU E E
    S: E E

Some comments about this example:
- Instead of K, KN can be used as well. This means over to exactly the other station. In principle another station could answer after the K, I've never seent this happen though.
- note how sometimes the full A1BCD DE HB9HUS is used, sometimes just the prosign BK. At the start and the end of the QSO always use the full callsigns.
- = is the short form for the prosign B̅T̅
- Important information such as Name and QTH is repeated
- SK shows the end of the QSO

### QRQ 599 stations
Some stations prefer a very short and very fast QSO style. This may be, because they want to make as many QSO as possible or because they are in high demand (e.g. rare DX stations). They often use high WPM above 30wpm and only respond with 599 to your call.

A qso could look like this:

    S: CQ A1BCD CQ A1BCD
    Y: HB9HUS
    S: HB9HUS 599
    Y: R 599 TU
    S: TU CQ A1BCD

Even when your speed is way below the speed of these stations, you can work them. As you are not able to send this fast, you can store your callsign and "R 599 TU" in a memory of your transceiver. You can then go on the frequency of the station and decode, letter by letter, their callsign. Then you can send your callsign from the memory of your transceiver. You should recognize your callsign and can then confirm it.

### Contest QSO
Contest QSOs are done in the context of a contest and are very short. The exact format depends on the contest the station participates in.  Apart from the 599, some other information is often exchanged.

A contest CQ call can usually be identified by the abbreviation "TEST" in the call, e.g. "CQ TEST HB9HUS". Sometimes the operator adds the abbreviation of the contest in the name as well, e.g. "CQ WW TEST HB9HUS".

The exchange includes some information, often just a sequential number, sometimes some other information such as the CQ zone you operate from or more complex information.

A qso cood look like this:
    S: CQ TEST A1BCD
    Y: HB9HUS
    S: HB9HUS 599 007
    Y: 599 127

Where 007 and 127 are the numbers of QSOs the station has done in the contest.

When you hear a contester online, you can look in some of the contest calendars to see which one it could be. You will find information on the exchange and more details there.

Some sites are:
- https://www.contestcalendar.com/
- https://www.cqcontest.eu/

Some more info on contesting:

### Rag chew QSO
When you get into rag chewing, you probably outperformed this simple document.

In principle during tag chewing the normal QSO is extended even more with additional information.

Have a look [here](https://morsecode.ninja/files/Sample-Rag-Chew-QSO-v10.pdf)

### Special programs
There are some other types of QSOs you might encounter online. Some examples are long running award programs such as "summits on the air" (SOTA) or "parks on the air" (POTA).

Most QSOs in these programs are similarly short than contest programs, mostly a little "friendlier". There is space for a GM and longer "good-byes".

Example:

    S: CQ SOTA de A1BCD/P K
    Y: HB9HUS
    S: HB9HUS GM ES TNX FER CALL UR 599 599 K
    Y: GM UR 559 73 ES TU
    S: TU ..
    Y: ..

## Stuff people don't like
You might notice things that people say, they don't like. Be it on their QRZ.com page, on reddit or in forums. I list them here just for you to be aware of them.
- 599 QSOs - they prefer longer QSOs
- CW decoders - they consider only decoding by ear real CW
- FT8 - some love it, some hate it
