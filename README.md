# HB9HUS - Notes on learning CW
## Introduction
This document contains my findings that I had during my journey for learning CW by myself. It will certainly contain errors. If so, write me or start a discussion with a github issue.

There are many other ways you can learn be it different ways to teach it your self or by taking courses. For example, I've only heard good things about the CW courses of the [long island cw club](https://longislandcwclub.org/).

Most stuff I wont write in too much detail but link to the places where I learned about it. I try to give simple recommendations where there is much choice (almost everywhere).

### What is there to learn
When starting to learn CW, you are probably not aware, that there are many different things that you can learn. These are:
- Receiving CW
Receiving CW is the hard part of being a CW operator. Starting with the letters
- Sending CW
Sending is much easier than receiving.
- Procedures
Being a CW operator includes not only sending and receiving the letters and words in CW but many procedural things such as abbreviations or QSO formats.

I will try to describe the different points in the following chapters.

### How long will it take
This is a very individual question and depends on many factors.

- You should be able to learn the letters within 2-3 months.
- Soon after that you can go on the air and do a first very slow QSO
- It will probably take a year to be proficient at 15wpm
- It usually seems to take about 2 years to get to 25wpm

But have a look at section "Receiving speed" below, there is not "one" speed you are at.

## Receiving CW
- letters
- hard copy or head copy
- getting faster
- getting fast
- instant character recognition
- instant word recognition (much later)
- abbreviations and q-codes

Some very good information is to be found on the [advice page](https://morsecode.ninja/advice/) of morse code ninja.

### The letters
Learning the letters is the obvious starting point on your journey to learn CW. There are many texts that describe this process in detail.

There are probably hundreds of tools for learning CW to be found online. Every ham with coding skills seems to have written one.

My simple recommendation is to use [Learn CW Online - LCWO](https://lcwo.net). This webpage is used by many and can give you an immediate start. Unfortunately it is not (at the time of this writing) responsive and not easy to use on mobile. There you can take [Morse Mania](https://www.ecosia.org/search?tt=mzl&q=morse%20mania).

### Hard copy or head copy
You must decide, whether you want to write down what you hear or just reconstruct the words and sentences in your head.

Hard copy (pen or keyboard) has some speed limitations. You can only write so fast. In the beginning and when you are a fast typist, this wont matter too much.

Head copy gives you more instant access to the meaning of the communication. You do not have to read what was sent.

Most recommendations I have seen recommended to start with or switch early to head-copy. This worked for me as well.

For a more detailed description of this have a look at [advice page](https://morsecode.ninja/advice/#SoYouWantToGoFaster) on morse code ninja.

### Getting faster
Once you know your letters, you probably want to get faster, get rid of the farnsworth timing and get up to a speed which can be used on the air.

This is done by listening to different forms of texts in your tool of choice. For me this tools are most of the time the videos of [morse code ninja](https://morsecode.ninja/practice/index.html).

Start with more trainings on single letters. Then try some simple two letter words. Increase the complexity of the words, either by taking longer words or more complex things such as callsigns. Once that works, go to combinations of words.

Once you are confident with these excercises, you can increase the speed. It can also make sense, to practice simple things (e.g. three letter combinations) at a higher speed and more difficult things (e.g. top 100 words) at a slightly slower speed.

Don't forget to go online as well early on to train your ear to real operators. It can already be fun to recognize single letters in the stream of a qso.

This can easily be done with a [web sdr](http://websdr.org/).

### Getting fast
As I am not fast yet, I can not really comment on this. Have a look at this article on morse code ninja: https://morsecode.ninja/advice/#LearningApproachToQRQ

### Receiving speed
CW is measured in words per minute (WPM) or characters per minute (CPM). CPM is 5 times WPM.

What speed you can receive depends on many different factors:
- perfect timing or human operator that makes timing errors
- only cw sounds or background noise and fading
- understanding the structure of the text that you receive (e.g. standard qso helps a lot)
- your daily form
- number of repetitions (e.g. you can copy a callsign of a contest station listening to it multiple times at a very high speed)

This means that, even if you can copy multiple words at 22 wpm with a morse training tool, does not mean that you can do so on the air.

## Sending CW
Sending is much easier than receiving. 

### The key to use
There are several different typs of key for sending morse code. As you can imagine there are many and divergent opinions on which one is best.

I decided on starting with an automatic keyer with a paddle. With this setup, you do not have to get the timings of Dits and Dahs right. The keyer does that for you.

### Practice sending
When you have a certain proficiency receiving CW it will be easy to know how to send a character. Getting your fingers to do so can be a little trickier.

You can take any source of text and send it. Some ideas are:
- an example QSO
- Text from a news- or wikipedia article
- listen to a text in CW and then send it

You will notice with which characters or character-combinations pose a problem. Repeat them until you can send them reliably.

### Sending from written text
When you can read the text you want to send, you just have to translate the written letters to morse code. This is much easier than sending everything from your head.

To practice this, you can take any text or written down QSO and send it.

### Sending from your head
When sending from your head, you need to spell out the word you want to send. This can take away brain power for the sending.

Practice this by sending examples QSOs from your head.

## Procedures
### Abbreviations
CW is a slow form of communication. To increase the density of information, we use many abbreviations and the so called Q-Codes (see next section). When you first have a look at lists with these, you can easily feel overwhelmed by their length. But fear not in practice, only few of them are frequently used. You just have to learn the most frequent ones and can postpone the rest to later.

Frequent abbreviations

### Q-Codes
Q-Codes are three letter codes starting with the letter Q (as the name implies).

Frequent q-codes

### RST system
The RST system is used for exchanging information on the quality of the signal.

It consists of three numbers. Which describe readability (1-5), strength (1-9) and tone (1-9).

RST is usually sent in this way: "RST 599 599" or "UR RST IS 599 599". The value is usually repeated. Often, the 9 is abbreviated with N: "RST 5NN 5NN" (see the section on abbreviated numbers).

The most frequent value that is reported "correctly" on the air ist strength. RST such as 559, 579 etc. can be heard a lot. Readability other than 5 is sometimes reported as well. I have never heard anyone on the air reporting a tone other than 9.

Some stations always send 599, especially during contests. This removes the whole meaning of the system in this situation, it is just some text sent.

For more details look at the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-S-T_system)

### Abbreviated numbers

### QSO-Formats
- the letters
- abbreviations and q-codes
- QSO formats

### A "regular" QSO


### QRQ 599 stations
Some stations prefer a very short and very fast QSO style. This may be, because they want to make as many QSO as possible or because they are in high demand (e.g. rare DX stations). They often use high WPM above 30wpm and only respond with 599 to your call.

A qso could look like this:

S: CQ A1BCD CQ A1BCD
Y: HB9HUS
S: HB9HUS 599
Y: R 599 TU
S: TU CQ A1BCD

Even when your speed is way below the speed of these stations, you can work them. As you are not able to send this fast, you can store your callsign and "R 599 TU" in a memory of your transceiver. You can then go on the frequency of the station and decode, letter by letter, their callsign. Then you can send your callsign from the memory of your transceiver. You should recognize your callsign and can then confirm it.

### Contest QSO
Contest QSOs are done in the context of a contest and are very short. The exact format depends on the contest the station participates in.  Apart from the 599, some other information is often exchanged.

A contest CQ call can usually be identified by the abbreviation "TEST" in the call, e.g. "CQ TEST HB9HUS". Sometimes the operator adds the abbreviation of the contest in the name as well, e.g. "CQ WW TEST HB9HUS".

The exchange includes some information, often just a sequential number, sometimes some other information such as the CQ zone you operate from or more complex information.

A qso cood look like this:
S: CQ TEST A1BCD
Y: HB9HUS
S: HB9HUS 599 007
Y: 599 127

Where 007 and 127 are the numbers of QSOs the station has done in the contest.

When you hear a contester online, you can look in some of the contest calendars to see which one it could be. You will find information on the exchange and more details there.

Some sites are:
- https://www.contestcalendar.com/
- https://www.cqcontest.eu/

### Special programs
There are some other types of QSOs you might encounter online. Some examples are long running award programs such as "summits on the air" (SOTA) or "parks on the air" (POTA).

Most QSOs in these programs are similarly short than contest programs, mostly a little "friendlier". There is space for a GM and longer "good-byes".

Example:

S: CQ SOTA de A1BCD/P K
Y: HB9HUS
S: HB9HUS GM ES TNX FER CALL UR 599 599 K
Y: GM UR 559 73 ES TU
S: TU ..
Y: ..

- 599 QSOs - they prefer longer QSOs
- CW decoders - they consider only decoding by ear real CW
- FT8 - some love it, some hate it
